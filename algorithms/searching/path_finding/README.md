# Maze Solvers

Practicing different graph searches in order to solve mazes represented by a 2D array. I spent 30 minutes on these and did almost no testing, so expect bugs.


## To use:

Create a 2D maze array. Specify the start using 2, and the end using 3. Areas that are "blocked off" can be marked using 1. The rest should be 0.

BFS Solver will find the start row and column for you, DFS solver will make you specify. 

Use solveMaze() for both solvers to solve the maze and return the path. Use displaySolution() in order to prettily print the solution.
